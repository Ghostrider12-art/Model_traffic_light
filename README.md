## üß∞ Components Used

- 2 √ó 555 Timer ICs  
- 1 √ó Red LED  
- 1 √ó Yellow LED  
- 1 √ó Green LED  
- Resistors:  
  - 100kŒ©  
  - 68kŒ©  
  - 3 √ó 330Œ©  
- Capacitors: 2 √ó 100¬µF

## üîÅ Working Principle

- **IC1** controls the Red and Green LEDs, alternating them based on timing set using resistors and capacitors connected to Pins 6 and 7.
- **IC2** is responsible for blinking the Yellow LED briefly between transitions, representing caution.
- The cycle follows this pattern:
  - T1: Red ON
  - T2: Yellow ON
  - T3: Green ON
  - T4: Yellow ON
